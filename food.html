<h1 align="center">INDIAN CUISINE</h1>
<article style="padding:10px;margin:5px;background-color:#e8e8e8;">
<p>Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to the Indian subcontinent. Given the diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits. Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion, in particular Hinduism and Islam, cultural choices and traditions. Historical events such as invasions, trade relations, and colonialism have played a role in introducing certain foods to this country. The Columbian discovery of the New World brought a number of new vegetables and fruit to India. A number of these such as potatoes, tomatoes, chillies, peanuts, and guava have become staples in many regions of India. Indian cuisine has shaped the history of international relations; the spice trade between India and Europe was the primary catalyst for Europe's Age of Discovery.  Spices were bought from India and traded around Europe and Asia. Indian cuisine has influenced other cuisines across the world, especially those from Europe (especially Britain), the Middle East, Southern African, East Africa, Southeast Asia, North America, Mauritius, Fiji, Oceania, and the Caribbean.</p>

<h2>Tandoori Chicken</h2>
<p> Tandoori chicken, also known as murgh tandoori is a popular North Indian appetizer where chicken is marinated with lime juice, yogurt, and aromatic spices and then roasted or grilled  in a tandoor, a cylindrical clay oven until perfection. It is best served with green chutney, some sliced onions, and lime wedges. Tandoori chicken is a low-carb (keto) and gluten-free recipe that is super easy to make and takes only 15 minutes of active preparation time. The homemade version gets its beautiful red-orange hue from the use of the best quality Kashmiri red chili powder, unlike the restaurant where they add red color to it. You can serve it for your house party appetizers or as a side dish with your North Indian meals.Tandoori chicken was traditionally made in a clay oven or tandoor, but since modern homes do not have clay ovens anymore so it is cooked in regular oven, air fryer, stovetop, or grill. The dish originated from the Indian subcontinent and is popular in many other parts of the world.</p>

<h2>Samosa</h2>
<p>A samosa is a fried or baked pastry with a savory filling, including ingredients such as spiced potatoes, onions, peas, chicken and/or other meats. It may take different forms, including triangular, cone, or half-moon shapes, depending on the region. Samosas are often accompanied by chutney, and have origins in medieval times or earlier. Samosas are a popular entrée, appetizer, or snack in the local cuisines of South Asia, the Middle East, Central Asia, East Africa and other regions. Due to emigration and cultural diffusion from these areas, samosas today are often prepared in other parts of the world. The samosa is prepared with an all-purpose flour (locally known as maida) and stuffed with a filling, often a mixture of diced and cooked or mashed boiled potato (preferably diced), onions, green peas, lentils, ginger, spices and green chili. A samosa can be vegetarian or non-vegetarian, depending on the filling. The entire pastry is deep-fried in vegetable oil or rarely ghee to a golden brown. It is served hot, often with fresh green chutney, such as mint, coriander, or tamarind. It can also be prepared in a sweet form. Samosas are often served in chaat, along with the traditional accompaniments of either a chickpea or a white pea preparation, served with yogurt, tamarind paste and green chutney, garnished with chopped onions, coriander, and chaat masala</p>

<h2>Jalebi</h2>
<p>Jalebi, is a popular sweet snack in south and west Asia, Africa, and Mauritius. It goes by many names, including jilapi, jilebi, jilipi, zulbia, jerry, mushabak, z’labia, or zalabia. The south Asian variety is made by deep-frying maida flour (plain flour or all-purpose flour) batter in pretzel or circular shapes, which are then soaked in sugar syrup. Jalebi is eaten with curd or rabri (in North India) along with optional other flavors such as kewra (scented water). In some west Asian cuisines, jalebi may consist of a yeast dough fried and then dipped in a syrup of honey and rose water.[citation needed] The North African dish of Zalabia uses a different batter and a syrup of honey (Arabic: ʻasal) and rose water. Jalebi can be served warm or cold. They have a somewhat chewy texture with a crystallized sugary exterior coating. Citric acid, lime juice and rose water is sometimes added to the syrup. Similar but distinct dishes include imarti, chhena jalebi, lokma, zalabiyeh, and bamiyeh.</p>
